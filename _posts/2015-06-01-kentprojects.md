<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://kentprojects.github.io/">KentProjects</a></h4><p>KentProjects was a final year project undertaken by <a href="https://jdrydn.com">James Dryden</a>, <a href="http://matthewhou.se/">Matt House</a> and <a href="http://matt.weeks.codes/">Matt Weeks</a> over the course of our fourth year at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University Of Kent</a>. KentProjects aims to build upon, and improve the current system that final year students use to choose their projects.</p></blockquote>

Working closely with [Matt House](http://matthewhou.se/) and [Matt Weeks](http://matt.weeks.codes/) in my final year of University, we built a web-platform for our dissertation to help new third-year students looking for groups & final-year-projects. I focused on the backend service, writing the entire stack in PHP (better the devil you know), building my own framework as I went along, and Iâ€™m pleased to say the entire project is open-sourced on Github ðŸ˜Ž
