title: Telegram Hero
---

If you've ever used [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), you'll know how great it is to chat securely between people. And if you're a developer and you've checked out Telegram Bots, you'll know [there is an API]() to allow you to programmatically communicate with people.

Awesome!

â€¦ Well, nearly awesome.

```js
var bot = new TelegramBot('my-awesome-token-here');

bot.sendMessage('Hello, world!', callback);
```

Most modules written for Node are built around instances, similar to the above. And, whilst this is fine for just one, or a couple of bots, it's not ideal for a service with many potential bots. And these solutions aren't very flexible when it comes to [the webhooks feature](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook) that Telegram bots work with.

So instead, here is a simplified module to interact with Telegram & users with a focus on flexibility.

```js
var telegram = require('telegram-hero');

telegram.send({
  token: '<insert-your-bot-token>',
  to: '<insert-a-chat-id>',
  method: 'sendMessage',
  message: {
    text: 'This are not the droids that you are looking for, move along.'
  }
}, callback);
```
You can use this with as many bots and as many webhooks as you like.

```js
telegram.send({
  token: '<insert-your-bot-token>',
  to: '<insert-a-chat-id>',
  method: 'sendPhoto',
  message: {
    photo: fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'droids.jpeg')),
    caption: 'This door is locked, move onto the next one'
  }
}, callback);
```

Itâ€™s built on top of the popular [`request`](github.com/request/request) module, to allow you to send attachments as streams, like above.

This API doesnâ€™t make any assumptions of your existing codebase, so if you require sending many messages to many users youâ€™ll need to add [`async`]() or an equivalent control-flow library to assist you. Take care when using `Promise.all` if the order of the messages matter to you ðŸ˜‰

Thereâ€™s also support for incoming webhooks, to make handling multiple bots relatively easy:

```js
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var express = require('express');
var telegram = require('telegram-hero');

var app = express();

/**
 * /webhook/amazing-bot/4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2
 */
app.post(
  '/webhook/:bot_name/:bot_auth',
  bodyParser.json(),
  telegram.api({
    bots: {
      'amazing-bot': {
        name: 'The Amazing Bot',
        auth: '4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2',
        token: '<insert-this-bots-token>'
      },

      // Or, if you're lazy, you can use
      'simple-bot': '4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2'
      // Which will be constructed into a proper bot similar to:
      //   'simple-bot': {
      //     name: 'simple-bot',
      //     token: '4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2'
      //   }
      // HOWEVER this isn't advised, since the authentication will be *anything* that satisfies :bot_auth!
    }
  }),
  function (req, res, next) {
    // req.telegram.message is the message object.
    // req.telegram.bot is the bot object that we passed into the middleware.

    // An error with status code 403 is returned if authentication fails

    // Reply to the incoming message.
    // The bot token, chat id, and reply_to_message_id are preset.
    req.telegram.reply({
      method: 'sendMessage',
      message: {
        text: 'Thanks for the reply! Have a nice day'
      }
    });

    res.status(200); // Don't forgot to reply to Telegram, so they know the message was received correctly!
  }
);

/**
 * If you don't want to use `:bot_name` or `:bot_auth` as params, you can instruct the middleware to use different ones
 * like this example shows:
 *
 * /webhook/amazing-bot/4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2
 */
app.post(
  '/webhook/:telegram_bot_slug/:telegram_bot_auth',
  bodyParser.json(),
  telegram.api({
    bots: {
      'amazing-bot': {
        name: 'The Amazing Bot',
        auth: '4b238abe064c9d6c860e386d8cbf8cd2',
        token: '<insert-this-bots-token>'
      }
    },
    bot_name_param: 'telegram_bot_slug',
    bot_auth_param: 'telegram_bot_auth'
  }),
  function (req, res, next) {
    // Or, if you want to reply directly to Telegram, you can do so like you usually would:
    res.status(200).json({
      method: 'sendMessage',
      text: 'Thanks for the reply! Have a nice day'
    });
  }
);

app.listen(3000);
```

And thatâ€™s it! This is in use in a personal project of mine, which sends me notifications from my online services via Telegram ðŸ’ª
