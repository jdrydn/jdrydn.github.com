**Wöbu** - "_what about you_" - was an app for users looking to react in real-time to events or friends posts by
creating an animated GIF of their expression.

The backend platform was one of my earliest production-level projects written in **NodeJS**, although realistically all
it did was execute MySQL stored procedures & store images to specific locations on Rackspace's CDN. Some of the MySQL
stored procedures were rather interesting, ranging from fetching entire comment threads with a single query (and then
some clever sorting at the API layer) to returning chronical feeds with live engagement numbers.

The app itself was built by the wonderful [@wakachamo](https://twitter.com/wakachamo), and it was awesome to work in
such a tight development environment, with the occasional accent breakout & reddit post to keep us entertained well
into the early hours of the morning!

Ultimately it was a fun app that I loved working on, and it convinced me that this profession is where I want to be:
building products & services for people to consume on a daily basis ✌️
