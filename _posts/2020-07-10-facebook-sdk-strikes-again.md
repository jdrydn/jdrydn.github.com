The cause of the problem is not yet known but early reports suggest it's because of an issue involving Facebook's SDK, which apps use to manage logins.</p></blockquote>

> Facebook acknowledged on its developer platform [this morning](https://developers.facebook.com/status/issues/1739188102911114/) that its software was causing problems. “We are aware and investigating an increase in errors on the iOS SDK which is causing some apps to crash,” said the firm. In [a GitHub thread](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/issues/1431) posted around 7AM ET, numerous developers reported problems with their apps and blamed Facebook, too.

> ... the root of the issue is that Facebook encourages developers to integrate its log-in services into their apps by offering them valuable insights about app usage and advertising in return.

... This is just mind-blowing!
