**James Dryden**

*22. Tech geek. Mac, iPad & iPhone user. Blogger. Developer. Student.*

I am pretty much always online. You can find me [tweeting][twitter], on [facebook](//facebook.com/jdrydn), and often publishing stuff to [Github][github] and [Bitbucket][bitbucket]. Oh, and there is [LinkedIn][linkedin] too!

I am a web developer at heart, working in **NodeJS** & **PHP**, usually powered by a **MySQL** database and outputting **HTML**, and then brought to life using **JavaScript**. I've used various PHP frameworks in the past (including *CodeIgniter* & *Kohana*), and I've written a few NodeJS apps using *ExpressJS*. I've produced HTML to the *HTML5* standard and styled with *CSS3*, and I've got plenty of experience with *jQuery* (although these days I prefer vanilla Javascript!). I also have some experience with *document-driven databases* like *MongoDB* and *RethinkDB*.

I've also written some PHP frameworks in the past. All of which build upon concepts and ideals that I've used in the past (and like) whilst learning web development. If you're interested by them have a read [over here](./php-frameworks.html). These days, I prefer to take files and classes from previous projects and join them together!

I am studying at the [University Of Kent][kent], working towards a degree in [Computer Science][cs.kent]. My degree also involved a placement year, throughout which I worked as a web developer at [Monitise Content][markcomedia], and absolutely loving it! I have a list of previous work too, which you can [read about here](./previous-work.html). Currently, I am back at University finishing my degree!

I write a blog over at [codewithportals.com](//codewithportals.com) in my free time, focusing on coding and technology. I've also written some articles on [Medium][medium], because I love their minimal online writing tool!

I like to use *Git*, *[Github][github]* & *[Bitbucket][bitbucket]* to host projects and code where I can, because in my opinion open code is good code. I've also got experience using *SVN*, which I've used for several projects at University, Overheard and Mindwork Labs.

I also have a [small portfolio of work](./portfolio.html), where you can read more about my projects above, plus information on previous projects and work done for others.

This site itself has a fairly **minimal** theme, but the structure behind the site is fairly interesting, which you can [read about on the Github repository for this site](//github.com/jdrydn/jdrydn.github.io#about-this-site).

If you do want to contact me, you can [email me](mailto:james@jdrydn.com) or [tweet me][twitter].
