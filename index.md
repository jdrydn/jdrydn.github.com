**Hello there. I'm James. Or jdrydn. Or jdryden.**

*19. Tech geek. Speaking English, HTML, PHP and learning JS. Mac, iPhone & iPad user. Blogger. Developer.*

I am pretty much always online. You can find me [tweeting][twitter], shouting on [App.net](//alpha.app.net/jdrydn), on [facebook](//facebook.com/jdryden), publishing stuff to [GitHub](//github.com/jdrydn), or generally browsing [Forrst](//forrst.me/jdrydn).

I've worked with **HTML** (*incl. HTML5 & CSS*), **PHP** (*including frameworks like CodeIgniter*) and **JS** (*including jQuery*). I'm also familiar with *MySQL*, which is extremely efficient when combined with PHP!

I developed [ThatPixel](//thatpixel.com), a simple social sharing website, for my A2 Computing coursework. I am planning to rewrite it one day.

In a night I wrote [If I Was CEO](//ifiwasceo.com), a site where users sign in using their Twitter accounts and comment on what they would have done if they were CEOs of leading corporations and companies. I've recently been expanding with Facebook integration.

I've written some frameworks, [exp0](//github.com/jdrydn/exp0) and [leaf](//github.com/jdrydn/leaf). Both of which build upon concepts and ideals that I've used (and like) whilst learning web development.

Currently I'm a developer at [Overheard](//overheard.co), alongside [Chris Ewbank](//djpc.org.uk) and [Rufus Honour](//rufushonour.com). You can read about its development on the [our development blog](//blog.overheard.co).

Over the summer I've been working at [Mindwork Labs](//mindworklabs.com) as their **Code Hero**, on various aspects of [MyDeals](//mydeals.com)!

I also have a [small portfolio of work](./portfolio), where you can read more about my projects above, plus information on previous projects and work done for others.

If you do want to contact me, you can [email me](mailto:james@jdrydn.com) or [tweet me][twitter].
