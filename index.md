**James Dryden**

*20. Tech geek. Galaxy S4, Mac & iPad user. Blogger. Developer. Student.*

I am pretty much always online. You can find me [tweeting][twitter], shouting on [adn](//alpha.app.net/jdrydn), on [facebook](//facebook.com/jdrydn), publishing stuff to [Github][github], or generally browsing [Forrst](//forrst.me/jdrydn).

I am a web developer, working in **NodeJS** & **PHP**, usually powered by a **MySQL** database and outputting **HTML** and brought to life using **JavaScript**. I've used various PHP frameworks in the past (including *CodeIgniter* & *Kohana*), and I've written a few NodeJS apps using *ExpressJS*. I've produced HTML to the *HTML5* standard and styled with *CSS3*, and I've got plenty of experience with *jQuery* (although these days I prefer vanilla Javascript!). I also have some experience with *document-driven databases* like *MongoDB* and *RethinkDB*.

I've also written some PHP frameworks, which you can read about over here. All of which build upon concepts and ideals that I've used in the past (and like) whilst learning web development. If you're interested by them have a read [over here](./php-frameworks.html).

Taking a year in industry placement as part of my degree, I am currently working as a web developer at [Monitise Content][markcomedia], and absolutely loving it! I have a list of previous work too, which you can [read about here](./previous-work.html).

I write a blog over at [codewithportals.com](//codewithportals.com) in my free time, focusing on coding and technology. However recently I've been writing articles on [Medium][medium], which has been an excellent experience and I really enjoy writing using their minimal online writer.

I like to use *Git* & *[Github][github]* to host projects and code where I can, because in my opinion open code is good code. I've also got experience in using *svn*, which I've used for several projects at University, Overheard and Mindwork Labs.

I also have a [small portfolio of work](./portfolio.html), where you can read more about my projects above, plus information on previous projects and work done for others.

This site itself has a fairly **minimal** theme, but the structure behind the site is fairly interesting, which you can [read about on the GitHub repo page for this site](//github.com/jdrydn/jdrydn.github.io#about-this-site).

If you do want to contact me, you can [email me](mailto:james@jdrydn.com) or [tweet me][twitter].
