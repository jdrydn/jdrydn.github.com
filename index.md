**Hello there. I'm James. Or jdrydn. Or jdryden.**

*19. Tech geek. Speaking English, HTML, PHP and learning JS. Mac, iPhone & iPad user. Blogger. Developer.*

I am pretty much always online. You can find me [tweeting][twitter], shouting on [adn](//alpha.app.net/jdrydn), on [facebook](//facebook.com/jdryden), publishing stuff to [Github][github], or generally browsing [Forrst](//forrst.me/jdrydn).

I am a web developer, with strong background in **PHP** (including *PHP5* and a few frameworks like *CodeIgniter* & *Kohana*), **MySQL**, *HTML* (including *HTML5* and *CSS3*), **JavaScript** (including *jQuery*), and I am currently teaching myself **NodeJS** (including *MongoDB* and *ExpressJS*) [over here](//code.withportals.com/2012/11/node).

I developed [ThatPixel](//thatpixel.com), a simple social sharing website, for my A2 Computing coursework. I am planning to rewrite it one day.

In a night I wrote [If I Was CEO](//ifiwasceo.com), a site where users sign in using their Twitter accounts and comment on what they would have done if they were CEOs of leading corporations and companies. I've recently been expanding with Facebook integration.

I've written some frameworks, [exp0](//github.com/jdrydn/exp0) and [leaf](//jdrydn.com/leaf). Both of which build upon concepts and ideals that I've used (and like) whilst learning web development. I've also written some documentation for Leaf, which you can [read here](//jdrydn.com/leaf).

Currently I'm a developer at [Overheard](//overheard.co), alongside [Chris Ewbank](//djpc.org.uk) and [Rufus Honour](//rufushonour.com). You can read about its development on the [our development blog](//blog.overheard.co).

Over the summer I've been working at [Mindwork Labs](//mindworklabs.com) as their **Code Hero**, on various aspects of [MyDeals](//mydeals.com)!

I write a blog over at [code.withportals.com](//code.withportals.com) in my free time, focusing on coding and technology.

I like to use *Git* & *[Github][github]* to host projects and code where I can, because in my opinion open code is good code (although, if stuff is private I've got a *[Gitlab](//gitlabhq.com)* instance ready to go!). I've also got experience in using *svn*, which I've used for several projects at University, Overheard and Mindwork Labs.

I also have a [small portfolio of work](./portfolio), where you can read more about my projects above, plus information on previous projects and work done for others.

This site itself has a fairly **minimal** theme, but the structure behind the site is fairly interesting, which you can [read about on the GitHub repo page for this site](//github.com/jdrydn/jdrydn.github.com#about-this-site).

If you do want to contact me, you can [email me](mailto:james@jdrydn.com) or [tweet me][twitter].
