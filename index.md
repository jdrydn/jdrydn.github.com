**James Dryden**

*20. Tech geek. Speaking English, HTML, PHP and learning JS. Mac, iPhone & iPad user. Blogger. Developer.*

I am pretty much always online. You can find me [tweeting][twitter], shouting on [adn](//alpha.app.net/jdrydn), on [facebook](//facebook.com/jdryden), publishing stuff to [Github][github], or generally browsing [Forrst](//forrst.me/jdrydn).

I am a web developer, with strong background in **PHP** (including *PHP5* and a few frameworks like *CodeIgniter* & *Kohana*), **MySQL**, **HTML** (including *HTML5* and *CSS3*), **JavaScript** (including *jQuery*), and I am currently teaching myself **NodeJS** (including *MongoDB* and *ExpressJS*) [over here](//code.withportals.com/2012/11/node).

I've written some frameworks, [exp0](//github.com/jdrydn/exp0) and [leaf](//jdrydn.com/leaf). Both of which build upon concepts and ideals that I've used (and like) whilst learning web development. I've also written some documentation for Leaf, which you can [read here](//jdrydn.com/leaf).

Over the summer I've been working at [Mindwork Labs](//mindworklabs.com) as their **Code Hero**, working on the social zone of [MyDeals](//mydeals.com)!

I write a blog over at [code.withportals.com](//code.withportals.com) in my free time, focusing on coding and technology.

I like to use *Git* & *[Github][github]* to host projects and code where I can, because in my opinion open code is good code (although, if stuff is private I've got a *[Gitlab](//gitlabhq.com)* instance ready to go!). I've also got experience in using *svn*, which I've used for several projects at University, Overheard and Mindwork Labs.

I also have a [small portfolio of work](./portfolio), where you can read more about my projects above, plus information on previous projects and work done for others.

This site itself has a fairly **minimal** theme, but the structure behind the site is fairly interesting, which you can [read about on the GitHub repo page for this site](//github.com/jdrydn/jdrydn.github.com#about-this-site).

If you do want to contact me, you can [email me](mailto:james@jdrydn.com) or [tweet me][twitter].
