## Mindwork Labs

I spent the summer after a hackathon working at Mindwork Labs, a small startup based at Markco Media, and had a great time working with the fantastic team, made up of [Tom Packer][tom], [Mike Smith][mike] and [Bobby DeVeaux][bobby].

We were working on the flagship website, [MyDeals.com][mydeals], a (relatively successful) voucher website. But we weren't stopping there.

Over the next two years the team evolved, people came (like [Ben Harcourt][ben] and [Ross Tanner][ross]) and went, as the site evolved and grew.

We added a "community area" of the website, building a miniature social-network-esque layer on top of the standard voucher website, to encourage people to add deals themselves rather than the usual method of obtaining vouchers from merchants.

This seemed relatively successful, however over the two years the website (much like the British economy) boomed and recessed, until finally it became stuck in it's own "great depression" and we couldn't build the momentum we had earlier.

Mindwork Labs has since been "absorbed" by Markco Media, and the team has been integrated into the Markco tech team, so (no doubt) we'll still be working on MyDeals, but we will also be working on a variety of other projects and products that Markco Media have built.

Admittedly, I am rather sad that Mindwork Labs is no more. It was extremely challenging, equally rewarding, and great fun. I have a lot of "*if I could do it again I would...*" thoughts, but ultimately I am reflecting and building upon what I learnt at Mindworks and going forwards I am very excited to be part of Markco Media's future!
