      After reading a detailed article about now
      [Netflix handles scaling & versioning](https://medium.com/@nodejs/netflixandchill-how-netflix-scales-with-node-js-and-containers-cf63c0b92e57#.svecljpvr),
      I wrote a library for ExpressJS APIs to support versioning APIs through headers, with support for older apps &
      services that are already released and can't be updated!

      Referred to as "*the internet's largest community for car enthusiasts*", I joined Car Throttle straight out of
      University, replacing their existing PHP project with an event-driven platform built in Node. Worked with a strong
      team to push out apps for both iOS & Android and now my role is focused on building powerful in-house content
      aggregation tools for the content teams.

      Working closely with [Matt House](http://matthewhou.se) and [Matt Weeks](http://matt.weeks.codes) in my final year
      of University, to build a platform for my dissertations. Our project was a web-based platform to help new
      third-year students looking for groups & final-year-projects, and the module convenor was our client. I focused
      on the backend service, writing the entire stack in PHP (*better the devil you know*), building my own framework
      as I went along, and I'm pleased to say the entire project is open-sourced on Github ðŸ˜Ž

      A small group of talented individuals building an app for taking animated selfies, back in the days before
      Snapchat! The idea was to encourage people to take an animated selfie in response to content, such as a news
      article. I built & maintained the entire API for this app, in Node & MySQL, with the physical images being stored
      on a Rackspace CDN. I worked closely with [a fantastic iOS developer](https://twitter.com/wakachamo) and in a
      short amount of time we got the app out into peoples hands with all the features the team wanted in an MVP!

    summary: >
      Mindwork Labs ceased in January 2014 and the team merged into the parent company Markco Media, who ran
      *MyVoucherCodes*. My team began work on a new PHP platform for a new product, to ingest endless streams of voucher
      content & interact with booking APIs, and present the data in a unified format over a REST API. The end product
      was an app named "*More*" and I was a core engineer right up to the app release & liased with app developers to
      integrate platform-specific features such as push notifications. Markco Media was sold to Monitise in July 2014,
      and I left in August to finish my degree.

      Working in a close team of four, across the entire stack, building and maintaing an automated voucher website
      called *MyDeals*. Whilst technically a monolith-style platform, I spent my time building various features &
      services including an email service for weekly email digests containing voucher recommendations.

  #     A group of first-year students attended a hackathon near Tower Bridge, where they started working on a community
  #     platform where people could post funny things they overheard people say. We worked extremely hard over the weekend
  #     to create a loose prototype, and post-hackathon tried to stick to sprints in order to release an MVP of the
  #     platform, and unfortunately we never got close enough to release an MVP ðŸ˜¢

    summary: >
      Leaving with a **2:1** in Computer Science after three years and a placement year (at **Mindwork Labs**). I chose
      modules that focused on mobile computing, networking as well as a few business modules. In my final year I worked
      on a group project called "**KentProjects**", a web-based platform for new third-year students looking for a final
      year project to work on.
